Currently, they are all based on backtracking, with different additions for speeding up.\r\n\r\n###Abbreviations\r\nClassnames use abbreviations to let you know what they use:\r\n<ul> \r\n<li>BT: BackTracking</li>\r\n<li>FC: Forward Checking</li>\r\n<li>CP: Constraint Propagation</li>\r\n<li>MRV: Minimum Remaining Value</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by @Jogol and Joel\r\n","google":"UA-58368773-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
