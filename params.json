{"name":"Sudokuproject","tagline":"Comparing sudoku algorithms","body":"### Sudoku\r\nThis was created for our Degree Project in Computer Science, first cycle.\r\nIt contains many different versions of algorithms for solving sudoku puzzles (of chosen size, although the larger ones are very slow). Currently, they are all based on backtracking, with different additions for speeding up.\r\n\r\n###Abbreviations\r\nClassnames use abbreviations to let you know what they use:  \r\nBT = BackTracking  \r\nFC = Forward Checking  \r\nCP = Constraint Propagation  \r\nMRV = Minimum Remaining Value  \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by @Jogol and @Joel-Kallin\r\n","google":"UA-58368773-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
